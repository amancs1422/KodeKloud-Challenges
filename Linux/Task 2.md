## Task 2 : Group Creation and User Assignment

### The system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries has streamlined access management by implementing group-based access control. Here's what you need to do:
##### a. Create a group named nautilus_admin_users across all App servers within the Stratos Datacenter.
##### b. Add the user stark into the nautilus_admin_users group on all App servers. If the user doesn't exist, create it as well.

#### Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.
